### Checklist of completed tasks:
#### Task 1
- [ ] Select a real-world classification problem
- [ ] Select a suitable dataset for the chosen problem (must have 1200 samples after pre-processing)
- [ ] Select more than one approriate ML algo
- [ ] Evaluate the created models on the selected data
- [ ] Tune the models to achieve better performace 

#### Task 2
- [ ] 5 min demo video, with execution of all stages and output
- [ ] Demo must describe what is happening and give clearn reasoning
- [ ] Ensure proper visibility of the Text, Table, Graphs, reasonable font size, no noise, not blurry.
- [ ] Must use Jupyter Notebook

#### Task 3
- [ ] Analysing and pre-processing the data
- [ ] Applying different algorithms and methods to build learning models
- [ ] Making appropriate adjustments to improve the models’ performances
- [ ] Evaluating the models (metrics, cross validation, confusion matrices, etc.)
- [ ] Comparing the approaches and results of other existing pieces of work on the same problem

**Report**:
* Problem statement
* Existing approaches or methods and their results
* Similarities and differences between your work and the existing work
* Analysis and Evaluation
* Conclusion
*presentation*:
* Logical structure with clear and appropriate sections and subsections
* Appropriate and consistent format and presentation
* Correct references (datasets, models, figures, etc) and in-text citations
* Good scientific/academic writing
* Complete source code as text in Appendix B

**Notes**:
* Your reports should focus on how algorithms/methods/techniques are actually applied or
developments that are novel and specific to your work rather than how they work theoretically
* Your report should include appropriate outcomes such as data analysis diagrams, outcomes
from the models, code snippets, etc. to support your text.
* Include all your source code as text in Appendix B at the end of the report. Do not use
screenshots of your code in Appendix B Your code muse be presented as text (see coursework
template).
* A course work template is provided as a guide in “Assessment” section on Aula
* The 2000-word limit is the absolute maximum word count for the whole report. Reports that
are more than 10% over the word limit will result in a reduction of 10% of the marks e.g., a
mark of 60% will be reduced by 6% to 54%. The word limit includes quotations, but excludes
the (GitHub, datasets, OneDrive) URLs, bibliography, reference list, and appendices (see
coursework template)

#### Task 4
- [ ] One submission file
- [ ] Must contain GitHub link at the beginning of the report
- [ ] Repo must be accessible by examiners
- [ ] Readme present with link of dataset used
- [ ] Source code with appropriate comments and annotations 
- [ ] Demo video
